# 01-Guessing
My first game technology project: a guessing game written in Python. The puropse of this game is to teach me about simple 
data types and certain structures within Python. The player enters a number in a given range and is told whether they are correct and incorrect. If incorrect, they are told if their guess is too high or low. Upon correctly guessing the number, they are told how many tries they inputed and asked to play again. I added a few more personalized lines of dialogue to spice things up.
